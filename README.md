# Born Equal. Treated unequally.

By [Paula Pereda Suárez](https://paulapereda.com/)

Women in Uruguay are born in equal numbers to men. Girls do better at school and are more likely to progress to university, yet this advantage seems to evaporate in later life.

Somewhere along the line women start being treated unequally. Evidence of this can be found across all facets of Uruguay’s professional landscape.

This Quarto + Closeread project explores the representation of women in Uruguay’s economic, cultural, and political spheres, aiming to shed light on the challenges we face.
